This project demonstrates a simple Machine Learning model to predict employee salaries based on their years of experience using **Scikit-Learn's Decision Tree Regressor**.

It visualizes how a non-linear regression model fits data points compared to a simple linear approach.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict salary based on years of experience.
- **Model:** Decision Tree Regressor (from `sklearn`).
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib is used to plot the actual data points vs. the model's predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning model)
- Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
